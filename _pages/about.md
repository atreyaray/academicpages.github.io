> I like leveraging data and technology to solve problems. 

Aspiring data scientist interested in probabilistic machine learning (PML), natural language processing (NLP), the internet of things (IoT), and causal inference (CI).

I like using technology, and the unbounded power of data to solve problems. 

I am a (soon to be Master’s) Data Science student minoring in Economics. In the past, I have worked as a Data Analytics Trainee at Deloitte (2020), Teaching Assistant (2021) in CS courses, and a Learning Resources Developer (2021). This summer I will be working as an IoT research trainee at Ericsson. 

My university studies have exposed me to different subfields in Machine Learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning (RL), and Bayesian/probabilistic). My Bachelor’s thesis was titled Applications of Causality in RL. My current interests involve learning MLOps and how to productionise ML models at scale using the cloud.

I am also interested in CS more generally, having taken and taught programming courses, Operating Systems, and Databases at university. I have coded in Scala, Python and C++ to implement algorithms and develop software projects. I am also acquainted with full-stack web development using React, Node and Express and like developing web development projects. I thoroughly enjoy participating in hackathons and coding competitions to practice my problem-solving skills.
