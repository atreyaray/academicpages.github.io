> I like leveraging data and technology to solve problems. 


I am an aspiring data scientist who is passionate about the wonders of data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence and their endless applications in real world problems. I always try to not only analyze data but also come up with unique solutions making use of technology.

I have coded in Scala, Python and C++ to implement algorithms and develop software projects. I am currently working at Aalto University, creating tutorials and software projects about using graphics and animations in Scala.

I have taken several foundational courses like Data Science, Machine Learning, Databases and Artificial Intelligence to base my exploration of the Data Sciences. In the summer of 2019, I worked on different methods of data preprocessing, data pipeline creation and analysis to predict client dormancy at Deloitte. At the moment, I am researching the uses of causal inference in reinforcement learning methods for my Bachelor's Thesis.


I have assisted students through their journey of learning programming as a Teaching Assistant. This has included support through chat, providing feedback on software projects and one-on-one zoom sessions with hundreds of students.

I learnt full-stack web development using React, Node and Express and am now developing exciting web development projects. I thoroughly enjoy participating in hackathons and coding competitions to practice my problem-solving skills.
